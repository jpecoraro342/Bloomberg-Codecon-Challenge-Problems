I'm not sure if these were the problems from the actual competition, as I was unable to make it, but I have been working on them some since then.

Note: My solution to Laundry Day doesn't pass the judges test cases. It seems like it works perfectly, but since the test cases aren't provided, I'm unsure of where it's breaking.
